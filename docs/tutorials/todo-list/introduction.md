# Todo List API

In this tutorial, we will create a TodoList app from the ground up. We will create the database models, an Express server using convenient controllers, and a frontend to interact with the API.

> If you haven't followed the [Getting Started](/documentation/getting-started) tutorial, please do so to become familiar with the universal-core app structure.

> This tutorial is offered in both TypeScript and JavaScript. Take a look at the controls with the **TS** and **JS** labels.

## Project initialization

Let's create our brand new project using the universal-core CLI:

<js-only>

```bash
ucore new todo-list
```

</js-only>

<ts-only>

```bash
ucore new todo-list --typescript
```

</ts-only>
