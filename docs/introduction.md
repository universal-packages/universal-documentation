# Introduction

Welcome to universal packages documentation! This site will focus in giving you the guides and tutorials to get you started with universal packages and showing you the kind of applications you can build with it. Universal packages was created with the belief that the web should be open and accessible to all, but even if we are building for the web it does not mean we get to stuck with the https servers we should be able to create any kind of server applications using the same code base for all of them.

# Universal Core

Even though you can use any package independently across the universal packages ecosystem, [universal-core](https://github.com/universal-packages/universal-core) is the main library across universal packages, it is a powerful and flexible framework to run you code in any kind ways, as a web server, as a data processing server, as a web socket server, as a file server, as a proxy server, as a web scraper, as a web crawler, as a web automation server, as a web testing server, as a web monitoring server, as a web analytics server, as a web security server, as game runner, as a synchronization server... you get the point.
