# Introduction

Welcome to the universal-packages documentation! This site will focus on giving you guides and tutorials to get you started with universal-packages and showing you the kinds of applications you can build with it. Universal-packages was created with the belief that the web should be open and accessible to all. Even though we are building for the web, it does not mean we are stuck with HTTPS servers. We should be able to create any kind of backend application using the same code base for all of them.

# Universal Core

Even though you can use any package independently across the universal-packages ecosystem, [universal-core](https://github.com/universal-packages/universal-core) is the main library. It is a powerful and flexible framework to run your code in many ways: as a web server, a data processing server, a web socket server, a file server, a proxy server, a web scraper, a web crawler, a web automation server, a web testing server, a web monitoring server, a web analytics server, a web security server, a game runner, a synchronization server... you get the point.
